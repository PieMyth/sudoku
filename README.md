# sudoku
A reasonable efficient Sudoku solver made in c. Will solve the example 9x9 board in 7,600 function calls in the recursion. Was in the "expert" category of a sudoku book I pulled it out.

## Getting Started

Copy the repository and compile it with gcc. Run the executable that pops out and follow the prompts to enter the board. Use a zero in place of a unknown box.
